Compilation:

Linux+gcc:
  just 'make', optionally: 'make depend'
  you will get TelescopeServerDummy and TelescopeServerLx200

Solaris,BSD,Hpux,...
  should be similas to Linux, perhaps slight modification required.
  Help is welcome.

WIN32:
  Compilation of TelescopeServerDummy succeded for me using MinGW.
  Please adapt the Makefile to your needs.
  TelescopeServerLx200 does not work, because I do not know how to
  program the serial ports under WIN32. Help is welcome.

---------------------
Usage examples:

> TelescopeServerDummy 10000
starts the dummy server listening on port 10000

> TelescopeServerLx200 10001 /dev/ttyS0
starts the Lx200 server listening on port 10001 and controlling
the Meade Lx200 telescope on /dev/ttyS0

---------------------

Other telescopes:

Any developer who wants to extend this library for using of his
telescope is welcome. Escpecially interresting would be the integration
of this library and of existing telescope libraries (indi,ascom,whatever)
in order to produce general purpose telescope server programs.

Or you could easily build your own telescope server program entirely
from scratch and take this library just as an example and a proof of concept
for the stellarium TCP telescope protocol.
